Known issues:

     - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl Deep recursion on subroutine "MockApp::setup" due
       to Adopt::NEXT not remembering which setup methods were already called
       and which not, like NEXT does. Log::Log4perl needs to be fixed and the
       problem should be described in Upgrading.pod. (rafl)

     - MX::Emulate::CAF - list assignment (see notes in Upgrading.pod and
       branch in svn)

     - Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie - cookie_name is undefined
       unless explicitly configured because setup_session isn't executed.

Documentation:

   - Catalyst/Upgrading.pod needs brushing up

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.
