        - Text::SimpleTable's go as wide as $ENV{COLUMNS} (jhannah)
          Patch written by Oleg Kostyuk <cub.uanic@gmail.com>
        - Improve docs for visit (mateu)
        - Add docs for finalize hook (dhoss)
        - Added ru/ua translations to error page
        - Improve the clarity and verbosity of the warning when component
          resolution uses regex fallback. (jhannah)
        - Handle leading CRLF in HTTP requests sometimes sent by IE6 in 
          keep-alive requests. (andyg)
        - Fixes for FastCGI with IIS 6.0 (janus)
        - Passing request method exported by Catalyst::Test an extra
          parameter used to be ignored, but started breaking if the parameter
          was not a hash in 5.8000_04. Extra parameter is now ignored if
          it isn't a hashref (t0m)
        - Fix request argumentss getting corrupted if you override the 
          dispatcher and call an action which detaches (for 
          Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::ACL) (t0m)
        - Fix calling use Catalyst::Test 'MyApp' 'foo' which used to work,
          but stopped as the 2nd parameter can be an options hash now (t0m)
        - Bump Moose dependency to fix make_immutable bug (t0m)
        - Use compile time extends in Catalyst::Controller (t0m)
        - Make Catalyst::Request::uploads attribute non-lazy, to fix
          test for Catalyst-Engine-Apache (t0m)
        - Bump version of MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast (t0m)
        - Stop using MooseX::Adopt::Class::Accessor::Fast by default, to stop
          breaking other packages which use Class::Accessor::Fast
        - Remove unused action_container_class attribute from 
          Catalyst::Dispatcher (t0m)
        - Replace {_body} instance access with calls to _body accessors (t0m)
        - Add backwards compatibility alias methods for private attributes on 
          Catalyst::Dispatcher which used to be public. Needed by 
          Catalyst::Plugin::Server and  Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::ACL 
          (t0m)
        - Fix return value of $c->req->body, which delegates to the body
          method on the requests HTTP::Body instance (t0m)
          - Test for this (t0m)
        - Fix calling $c->req->body from inside an overridden prepare_action
          method in a plugin, as used by Catalyst::Plugin::Server (t0m)
          - Test for this (t0m)
        - Fix assignment to Catalyst::Dispatcher's preload_dispatch_types and
          postload_dispatch_types attributes - assigning a list should later 
          return a listref. Fixes Catalyst::Plugin::Server. (t0m)
          - Tests for this (t0m)
        - Change streaming test to serve itself rather than 01use.t, making 
          test sync for engines easier (t0m)
        - Refactor capturing of $app from Catalyst::Controller into
          Catalyst::Component::ApplicationAttribute for easier reuse in other
          components (Florian Ragwitz)
        - Make the test suites YAML dependency optional (Florian Ragwitz)
        - Make debug output show class name for the engine and dispatcher
          rather than the stringified ref. (t0m)
        - Make MyApp immutable at the end of the scope after the setup
          method is called, fixing issues with plugins which have their 
          own new methods by inlining a constructor on MyApp (t0m)
          - Test for this and method modifiers in MyApp (t0m)
        - Fix bug causing Catalyst::Request::Upload's basename method
          to return undef (t0m)
          - Test for this (Carl Franks)
        - Fix loading of classes which do not define any symbols to not
          die, as it didn't in 5.70 (t0m)
          - Test for this (t0m)
        - Bump MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast dependency
          to force new version which fixes a lot of plugins (t0m)
        - Make log levels additive, and add documentation and tests
          for the setup_log method, which previously had none.
          Sewn together by t0m from two patches provided by David E. Wheeler
        - Switch an around 'new' in Catalyst::Controller to a BUILDARGS
          method as it's much neater and more obvious what is going on (t0m)
        - Add a clearer method on request and response _context 
          attributes, and use if from ::Engine rather than deleting
          the key from the instance hash (t0m)
        - Use handles on tree attribute of Catalyst::Stats to replace
          trivial delegation methods (t0m)
        - Change the following direct hash accesses into attributes:
          Catalyst::Engine: _prepared_write
          Catalyst::Engine::CGI: _header_buf
          Catalyst::Engine::HTTP: options, _keepalive, _write_error
          Catalyst::Request: _path
          Catalyst::Stats: tree
          (t0m)
        - Fix issues in Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI 
          and any other components which import (or define) their 
          own meta method by always explicitly calling
          Class::MOP::Object->meta inside Catalyst (t0m)
          - Add test for this (t0m)
        - Add test case for the bug which is causing the 
          Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication tests to fail (t0m)
        - Fix a bug in uri_for which could cause it to generate paths
          with multiple slashes in them. (t0m)
          - Add test for this (t0m)
        - Fix SKIP block name in t/optional_http-server-restart.t,
          stopping 'Label not found for "last SKIP"' error from 
          Test::More (t0m)
        - Workaround max_redirect 0 bug in LWP (andyg)

          dir (andyg)

        - Fix upload test to work with remote servers, don't check for 
          deleted files (andyg)

        - Use a predicate to avoid recursion in cases where the uri
          method is overridden by a plugin, and calls the base method,
          for example Catalyst::Plugin::SmartURI (t0m)
          - Test for this (caelum)
        - Compose the MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast role to

5.7099_03 2008-07-20 10:10:00
        - Fix regressions for regexp fallback in model(), view() and controller()
        - Added the supplied argument to the regexp fallback warning for easier
          debugging

5.7099_01 2008-06-25 22:36:00
        - Refactored component resolution (component(), models(), model(), et al). We now
          throw warnings for two reasons:
          1) model() or view() was called with no arguments, and two results are returned
             -- set default_(model|view), current_(model|view) or current_(model|view)_instance
             instead
          2) you call a component resolution method with a string, and it resorts to a regexp 
             fallback wherein a result is returned -- if you really want to search, call the
             method with a regex as the argument
        - remove 0-length query string components so warnings aren't thrown (RT #36428)

        - Added the ability to remove parameters in req->uri_with() by passing in
          an undef value (RT #34782)
        - Added $c->go, to do an internal redispatch to another action, while retaining the
          contents of the stash

5.7014  2008-05-25 15:26:00
        - Addition of .conf in restart regex in Catalyst::Engine::HTTP::Restarter::Watcher
        - Fix regression for relative uri_for arguments after a forward()   
          introduced in 5.7013 (Peter Karman)  
        - Fix regression for "sub foo : Path {}" in the root controller which 
          was introduced when attempting to allow "0" as a Path.

          symlinks in the HTTP::Restarter engine (Sebastian Willert)

        - Fixed bug where req->base and req->uri would include a port number when running
          in SSL mode.
        - Removed unnecessary sprintf in debug mode that caused warnings on locales where
          commas are used for decimal markers.
        - Improved error message for case when server picks up editor save
          files as module names. (James Mastros)

        - Fixed issue where development server running in fork mode did not
          properly exit after a write error.

5.7007  2007-03-13 14:18:00
        - Many performance improvements by not using URI.pm:
          * $c->uri_for (approx. 8x faster)

          Results in about a 9% performance increase when handling GET/HEAD
          requests.
        - Add a default body to redirect responses.
        - MyApp->model/view now looks at MyApp->config->{default_view/model}
