Catalyst::Manual::Installation::CentOS4 - Catalyst Installation on CentOS 4



=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document provides directions on how to install CentOS 4 (a rebuild
of RedHat Enterprise 4) and then install Catalyst.

If you already have a functioning install of CentOS, RHEL, or a
comparable Linux OS, you should be able to skip this first section and
go straight to the C<INSTALL CATALYST> section.

B<NOTE:> You might want to consult the latest version of this document.  It
is available at:
L<http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/Catalyst/trunk/Catalyst-Runtime/lib/Catalyst/Manual/Installation/CentOS4.pod>



=head1 INSTALL CENTOS

These directions are written for CentOS 4.3 on an i386 machine; however,
you can substitute other versions as they become available.
