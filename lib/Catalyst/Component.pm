=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Component - Catalyst Component Base Class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # lib/MyApp/Model/Something.pm
    package MyApp::Model::Something;

    use base 'Catalyst::Component';

    __PACKAGE__->config( foo => 'bar' );

    sub test {
        my $self = shift;
        return $self->{foo};
    }

    sub forward_to_me {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        $c->response->output( $self->{foo} );
    }
    
    1;

    # Methods can be a request step
    $c->forward(qw/MyApp::Model::Something forward_to_me/);

    # Or just methods
    print $c->comp('MyApp::Model::Something')->test;

    print $c->comp('MyApp::Model::Something')->{foo};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the universal base class for Catalyst components 
(Model/View/Controller).

It provides you with a generic new() for instantiation through Catalyst's
component loader with config() support and a process() method placeholder.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new($c, $arguments)

Called by COMPONENT to instantiate the component; should return an object
to be stored in the application's component hash.

=head2 COMPONENT($c, $arguments)

If this method is present (as it is on all Catalyst::Component subclasses,
it is called by Catalyst during setup_components with the application class
as $c and any config entry on the application for this component (for example,
in the case of MyApp::Controller::Foo this would be
MyApp->config->{'Controller::Foo'}). The arguments are expected to be a 
hashref and are merged with the __PACKAGE__->config hashref before calling 
->new to instantiate the component.

=head2 $c->config

=head2 $c->config($hashref)

=head2 $c->config($key, $value, ...)

Accessor for this component's config hash. Config values can be set as 
key value pair, or you can specify a hashref. In either case the keys
will be merged with any existing config settings. Each component in 
a Catalyst application has it's own config hash.

=head2 $c->process()

This is the default method called on a Catalyst component in the dispatcher.
For instance, Views implement this action to render the response body 
when you forward to them. The default is an abstract method.

=head2 $c->merge_config_hashes( $hashref, $hashref )

Merges two hashes together recursively, giving right-hand precedence.
Alias for the method in L<Catalyst::Utils>.

=head1 OPTIONAL METHODS

=head2 ACCEPT_CONTEXT($c, @args)

Catalyst components are normally initalized during server startup, either
as a Class or a Instance. However, some components require information about
the current request. To do so, they can implement an ACCEPT_CONTEXT method.

If this method is present, it is called during $c->comp/controller/model/view
with the current $c and any additional args (e.g. $c->model('Foo', qw/bar baz/)
would cause your MyApp::Model::Foo instance's ACCEPT_CONTEXT to be called with
($c, 'bar', 'baz')) and the return value of this method is returned to the
calling code in the application rather than the component itself.
