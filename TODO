Known Bugs:

   - Bug ->go or ->visit causes actions which have Args or CaptureArgs called
     twice when called via ->go or ->visit.

     Test app: http://github.com/bobtfish/catalyst-app-bug-go_chain/tree/master

Compatibility warnings to add:

   - $self->config should warn as config should only ever be called as a
     class method.

Proposed functionality / feature additions:

    - Log setup needs to be less lame, so Catalyst::Plugin::Log::* can die
      in a fire. Having $c->log_class would be a good start. kane volunteered
      to do some of this.

      Simple example: Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Colorful should just be a
      subclass of Catalyst::Log, no ::Plugin:: needed.

TODO for brach namespace_handling_refactor:

- refactor code in
  * Catalyst::Dispatcher::get_containers           # No Idea
  * Catalyst::Dispatcher::dispatch_type            # DONE

  * Catalyst::Controller::_parse_ActionClass_attr  # DONE
  * Catalyst::Dispatcher::_load_dispatch_types     # DONE
  * Catalyst::setup_plugins                        # DONE
  to use the same namespacing method

- Ok, so can you add tests for ->config(actions => { foo => { ActionClass => '+Bar' }});
