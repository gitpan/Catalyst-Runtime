Known Bugs:
   - Moose bug causes issues if you use Moose in your application, but want to
     use base classes which have not been converted to Moose yet.

     Tests in Moose for this are: http://tinyurl.com/c2k85c

     Note: This issue _does not affect_ components which have been converted to
           Moose, or applications which do not use Moose, and causes a 
           compile-time error if present.

   - Bug ->go or ->visit causes actions which have Args or CaptureArgs caled
     twice when called via ->go or ->visit.

     Test app: http://github.com/bobtfish/catalyst-app-bug-go_chain/tree/master

   - Certain errors in your application to do with using other code which does
     not exist can cause an 'Unknown error' issue.

Compatibility warnings to add:

   - $self->config should warn as config should only ever be called as a
     class method.
